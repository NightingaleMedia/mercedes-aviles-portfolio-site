title: David Blaine
description: “David Blaine is the greatest magician who ever lived.” Howard
  Stern made that on-air proclamation, a sentiment echoed by Penn Jillette of
  Penn and Teller, who referred to Blaine’s Street Magic as “the best TV magic
  special ever done.” Blaine was just twenty- three when Street Magic first
  aired on ABC, transforming televised magic by turning the camera on the
  audience. Spectators at home could feel the visceral reaction of people being
  astonished. The New York Times went on to declare that Blaine had “taken a
  craft that’s been around for hundreds of years and done something unique and
  fresh with it,” while The New Yorker prominently stated “he saved magic.”
